[X] Create a meal related to a user with the following informations: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[X] Name 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[X] Description

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[X] Date and time

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[X] Let the user select if this meal is on a diet or not

[X] Update one or more fields of a meal

[X] Delete a meal

[X] List all meals of a user

[X] List a single meal

[ ] Get metrics of a user by returning the following:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ ] Amount of meals

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ ] Amount of meals on a diet

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ ] Amount of meals off a diet

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ ] Best day on a diet

[X] The user can only view, edit and delete meals which he created.
