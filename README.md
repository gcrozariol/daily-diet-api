### ðŸš€ Daily Diet API

This challenge is about creating a RESTful API to control a daily diet. Here are the application's use cases:

[ ] Create a user
[ ] Idenfify the user when making a request
[ ] Create a meal related to a user with the following informations: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ ] Name 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ ] Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ ] Date and time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ ] Let the user select if this meal is on a diet or not
[ ] Update one or more fields of a meal
[ ] Delete a meal
[ ] List all meals of a user
[ ] List a single meal
[ ] Get metrics of a user by returning the following:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ ] Amount of meals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ ] Amount of meals on a diet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ ] Amount of meals off a diet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ ] Best day on a diet
[ ] The user can only view, edit and delete meals which he created.

### ðŸŽ¯ Running the App

Run the following command to start the project:

<code>npm run dev</code>

Now, with the server running locally using the port 3333, we are ready to make some requests.
