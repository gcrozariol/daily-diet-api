### ðŸš€ Daily Diet API

This challenge is about creating a RESTful API to control a daily diet. Here are the application's use cases:

[X] Create a user

[X] Idenfify the user when making a request

[X] Create a meal related to a user with the following informations: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[X] Name 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[X] Description

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[X] Date and time

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[X] Let the user select if this meal is on a diet or not

[X] Update one or more fields of a meal

[X] Delete a meal

[X] List all meals of a user

[X] List a single meal

[X] Get metrics of a user by returning the following:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[X] Amount of meals

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[X] Amount of meals on a diet

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[X] Amount of meals off a diet

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[X] Best day on a diet

[X] The user can only view, edit and delete meals which he created.
